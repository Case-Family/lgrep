#summary lgrep Examples

The idea behind lgrep is to have a grep-like tool for parsing Directory Server access logs.  This should, in principle, give us the capability to solve complex log parsing problems using relatively simple pipelines.  

It also means that the lgrep script itself does not need to solve every one of these problems, but can be more specifically targeted at solving its narrow set of problems well.  So, for example, the stats output will not likely be enhanced to provide etime stats per operation, because this can easily be accomplished by filtering the operation types in one execution of lgrep and piping the resulting log contents to the stats analyzer.

While these kinds of pipelines may be evident to unix users, it's possible that the flexibility of this approach is not immediately clear to every potential user of the script.  The usage examples, while intended to be reasonably provocative, are certainly less than exhaustive.  So on this wiki page, I'd like to start compiling some more detailed, comprehensive examples of how to use lgrep to solve complex access log parsing problems.
